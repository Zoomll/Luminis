# Luminis

### A language made by ChatGPT

Luminis is a language inspired by Lua that is interpreted by JavaScript. It was created with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4 as an experiment. It has made some interesting decisions. I had to guide it out of some bugs though.

Documentation will be added soon. Currently the interpreter cannot do much, but I am working on expanding it.
